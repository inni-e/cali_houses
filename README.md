# California Housing Price Predictor
This project is a Jupyter notebook containing an analysis and refinement of data of California's housing prices based on various factors such as geolocation, land area and residents' median incomes. This refined data is then used to develop a multiple regression model which predicts the price of a house based on these aforementioned factors.

The model is tested against it's own dataset, providing a RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) just over $40,000. This model will be further worked on to improve its accuracy.

The code can be accessed through your browser via Google CoLab.
